Android SignUp-Login with database

# inshort
A SignUp-Login system for an Android app involves setting up a database (e.g., SQLite) to store user data. During SignUp, users provide information that's validated and securely stored, including a hashed password. For Login, user-entered credentials are checked against the stored data. Successful login creates a session managed by a secure token. Security measures like password hashing, error handling, and password recovery are crucial. Regular updates help maintain system integrity.
